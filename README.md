## Installation

1. Run `./install.sh install`s

Magic!

#### Optional setup:

- A remote url to clone libft can be added in settings and you will be prompted on
running psetup if you would like to add it as a submodule (default: false).

- A tag directory can be set in settings, this marks the root directory for tag folders on your system, if set to a path psetup will list the subdirectories and
add a symlink to the subdirectory if specified in setup.


## Usage

Once installed you can run `psetup` in a root directory and it will prompt you for the rest.
